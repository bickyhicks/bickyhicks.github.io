    <h4>Director</h4>
    <p>In September 2019 I was approached by Questing Voles Productions and asked to direct their annual show at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. While the 2020 Edinburgh Fringe was unfortunately not able to go ahead, we are brainstorming other ways to put on a show in the meantime, and hope that we will be able to work together at the 2021 Edinburgh Fringe. </p>

    <h4>Treasurer</h4>
    <p>The Oxford University Light Entertainment Society is a charitable dramatic society operating out of Oxford University. We put on three original musicals per academic year and donate the profits to charity; averaging £1300 per year in donations. My role as treasurer was to manage the financial side of the productions, from creating show budgets to managing sales alongside additional sources of income. As part of the committee I also chose the production teams and selected scripts for each term’s show. </p>

  <h4>Assistant Director</h4>
  <p>I was the assistant director for an original musical with a cast of 25 people. I really enjoyed working with such a large and dynamic group of people, and this experience spearheaded my interest in directing.</p>

    <h4>Director and Co-producer</h4>
    <p>During my penultimate year at Oxford I directed a small cast of people in an original Jeeves and Wooster production, which we performed in care homes around Oxford. I  enjoyed the unique challenges presented by performing in such an environment, and I was really pleased to hear that the residents of the care homes enjoyed our performances.  </p>
